### 1.2.1 DNA as the genetic material of all living organisms

- Hereditary info passed down using [[DNA]]
	- [[RNA]] is used by some viruses
- [[Polymer]] made of monomers called [[nucleotide]]s

### Components of a nucleotide

> see: [[nucleotide]]

### 1.2.3 Sugar-phosphate bonding and "backbone"

- [[nucleotide]]s linked by [[covalent bond]]s between phosphate and sugar

![[Pasted image 20250802173532.png]]

- forms a sugar-phosphate backbone (strong)
- covalent bonds -> specified phosphodiester bonds - between phosphate group of one and pentose sugar of other


> [!caution] Watch Out!
> The position of each bond is important

> [!tip] Notation
> **Covalent bonds** are denoted by a **solid line**
> **Hydrogen bonds** are denoted by **dashed lines**

### 1.2.4 [[Bases]] in each nucleic acid

| Bases in DNA | Bases in RNA |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Adenine      | Adenine      |
| Thymine      | **Uracil**   |
| Cytosine     | Cytosine     |
| Guanine      | Guanine      |

> [!important] Watch Out!
> DNA - Thymine
> RNA - Uracil

> [!NOTE] Exam Tip
> You can use letters (ATCG/AUCG) in drawings, but you must use the full names in written answers

- The sequence of bases determine the genetic code

> [!summary] In summary
> DNA double helix - untwist and zoom in 
> you see the sugar-phosphate backbone, and the nitrogenous bases
> more zoom in -> you see the nucleotides, each having a phosphate and a base, nucleotides connected by covalent bonds

### 1.2.5 [[RNA]] as a [[polymer]] formed by condensation of [[nucleotide]] monomers

- [[RNA]] is a single strand of [[nucleotide]]s
- ***[[condensation reactions]]***: removal of water to create a covalent bond

### 1.2.6 DNA double helix

- double helix made of two antiparallel strands of [[nucleotide]]s
