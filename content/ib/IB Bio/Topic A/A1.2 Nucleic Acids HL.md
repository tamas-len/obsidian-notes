### 1.2.11 Directionality of RNA and DNA

- carbons are numbered

![[Pasted image 20250803190511.png]]

 - 5' (prime) and 3' ends

![[Pasted image 20250803190609.png]]

so strands are [[antiparallel]]:

> [!caution] Importance
> New [[nucleotide]]s can only be added to the 3' end


### 1.2.12 [[Purine]]-to-[[pyrimidine]] bonding as a component of DNA helix stability

- Each complementary pair has one [[purine]] and one [[pyrimidine]]
- All pairs are the same length
- Increases stability

[[Purine]]s: Adenine, Guanine (double ring structure)
[[Pyrimidine]]s: Cytosine, Uracil, Thymine (single ring structure)

### 1.2.13 Structure of a [[nucleosome]]

[[nucleosome|Nucleosome]]: DNA wrapped twice around a core of **8 histone proteins** (octomer of histone proteins)

- Additional **H1 histone stabilizes** the nucleosome and helps condense the DNA

- These nucleosomes are **joined by linker DNA** - the DNA between histone proteins

- [[Eukaryotes]] (plants, animals, fungi, etc) have [[nucleosome]]s
- [[Prokaryotes]] (bacteria) have naked DNA (no [[histone protein]]s)

### 1.2.14 Hershey-Chase experiment for DNA as the genetic material

- 1950s
- knew: [[chromosome]] were made of DNA and protein, and they carry genetic information
- which one is it? DNA or protein?
- luckily: viruses are also made up of DNA and protein

Viruses infect their host by infecting genetic material. Is it protein or DNA?
Two groups of viruses: one with radioactive protein (radioactive sulfur)
one with radioactive DNA (radioactive phosphorus)

viruses injected cells

cells spun in centrifuges --> heavy bits (containing cells) go to bottom

### 1.2.15 Chargaff's experiment
Data on the relative amounts of [[pyrimidine]] and [[purine]] bases across diverse life forms

Tetranucleotide hypothesis: DNA consisted of a repeating sequence of 4 [[nucleotide]]s in equal amounts and proteins were the genetic material

Tested [[nucleotide]] composition of several species --> variation >> false hypothesis


|               | A    | G    | C    | T    |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Human         | 31   | 19.1 | 18.4 | 31.5 |
| Salmon        | 29.7 | 20.8 | 20.4 | 29.1 |
| Mycobacterium | 15.1 | 34.9 | 35.4 | 14.6 |
| Polio virus   | 30.4 | 25.4 | 19.5 | 0.0  |

Notice how complementary base pairs have roughly the same amount --> because they are indeed in pairs
