### 2.1.1 Conditions on early Earth, prebiotic formation of C compounds

[[Pre-biotic]]: period on Earth before life existed

Conditions:
- very little oxygen
- lots of methane
- increased CO2
- higher temperatures
- no UV protection from atmosphere
- lots of lightning

conditions promote spntaneous reactions (currently not possible)
spontaneous formation of carbon compounds

--> living things changed conditions (like increased O2 and O3), so no more sponteneous life :(

### 2.1.2 Cells as the smallest units of self-sustaining life

Self-sustaining: using E to maintain highly-ordered state, living organisms can pass on this ability to their offspring

organisms --> unicellular or multicellular

evidence that cells are living:
 - each cell uses E to maintain order
 - some cells stop doing this and die
 - cells produce more cells
 - cells can live outside of the body in a culture

smaller cell components like organelles cannot do this

### 2.1.3 Explaining the spontaneous origin of cells

[[Pasteur's experiment]] falsified spontaneous generation

New cells come from existing cells!

Where did the first cell come from?

Several things:
 - [[catalysis]] / control over reactions
 - self assembly of [[polymer]]s
 - [[compartmentialisation]] / membrane formation (separating from the outside)
 - self-replicating molecules

### 2.1.4 Evidence for the origin of carbon compounds

[[Muller - Urey experiment]]

[[Prebiotic]] gas mixture and energy

produced[[ amino acid]]s

conclusion: carbon compounds arose on Earth before life evolved

### 2.1.5 Spontaneous formation of [[vesicle]]s
by [[coalescence]] of [[fatty acids]] into spherical bilayers

[[Vesicle]]s: structures surrounded by membranes

[[Phospholipids]] in the [[primordial soup]]

[[Phospholipids]] have both [[hydrophilic]] and [[hydrophobic]] end --> spontaneously form vesicles
Forms compartmentalised regions that were [[semipermeable]]

### 2.1.6 RNA as a presumed first genetic material

- RNA is self-replicating
- can act as a [[catalyst]] (no need for an [[enzyme]])
- some viruses have only RNA
- RNA mutates at a higher rate (because of no complimentary strand)

### 2.1.7 Evidence for a last unversal common ancestor

[[LUCA]] - Last Unviersal Common Ancestor

Evidence
- universal genetic code
- ribosome structure
- enzymes that synthesise DNA and RNA

likely life evolved separately several times, but evidence suggest that all non-extinct species evolved from a singles common ancestor

### 2.1.8 Estimate dates of the first living cells and the LUCA

carbon dating

Stromatolite fossils (cyanobacteria) in the [[Strelley Pool]], from 3.42 billion yrs ago
--> oldest fossils, but not oldest life form

carbon dating suggests life ([[LUCA]]) from 4.1 billion yrs ago

-----------

relationship between [[genome]] differences and the amount of time that has passed between common ancestors
--> based on this [[LUCA]] was about 4.5 billion yrs ago (~the same time as Earth's formation)

neither are provable, only falsifiable

### 2.1.9 Evidence for the evolution of the LUCA in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents
